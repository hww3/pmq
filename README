This is the Pike Message Queue (PMQ).

pmqd is the daemon, which listens on port 9999
pmqc is a message creator, it connects to the pmqd running on the loopback 
address.
pmqp is a message queue printer, it drains messages from a queue running 
on the loopback address.

There's currently no configuration or security. Similarly, there is no 
message persistance (yet).

The readers (PMQTopicReader and PMQQueueReader) support callback mode or 
blocking read mode. Messages are streamed to the reader upon subscription. 

Available Queue Types:

SimpleQueue: a simple point to point queue between a writer and a single 
consumer. Messages are held for the consumer and any waiting messages are 
delivered at subscription time. 

SimpleTopic: a single to many queue between x writers and y consumers. 
Messages are not held, and are delivered immediately to any subscribed 
sessions.

Queues and Topics are currently automatically created upon subscription; 
this is a configurable option.
